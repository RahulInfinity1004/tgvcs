# Steps to Build a Version Control System Using Django

## 1. Set Up the Django Project

### Install Django and PostgreSQL (or SQLite for development):
```bash
pip install django psycopg2
```

### Create a Django Project:
```bash
django-admin startproject version_control
cd version_control
python manage.py startapp tracking
```

### Update `settings.py`:
- Add `tracking` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.
- Configure your database with Postgre SQL or SQLite for development.

---

## 2. Build the Database Models

### Define Models:
- Create models for Channels and Uploads to manage file versions and metadata.

### Apply Migrations:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

## 3. Create Core Features

### File Upload Functionality:
- Implement an API for uploading files to specific channels.
- Automatically handle versioning based on existing files.

### Commit History:
- Create an API endpoint to retrieve the commit history for a specific channel.

---

## 4. Configure URLs

### Add Routes:
- Set up routes for file uploads and commit history retrieval.

---

## 5. Add Authentication

- Use Django's built-in authentication system for user management.
- Implement permissions to restrict access to files and channels.

---

## 6. Implement Frontend

### Option 1: Django Templates
- Use Django templates to create a basic interface for uploads and viewing commit history.

### Option 2: React Frontend
- Build a modern UI with React to interact with the Django backend.

---

## 7. Add GitHub Integration (Optional)

### Automate Commits to GitHub:
- Use GitHub's API to push file changes and commit messages to a GitHub repository.

### Tools:
- Use `PyGithub` to programmatically interact with GitHub.

---

## 8. Deploy the Application

### Deployment Options:
- Use platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
- Configure file storage with services like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

---

## 9. Future Enhancements

1. **Search and Filters**:
   - Add search functionality to filter files by name, channel, or date.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Use Docker for containerization.
   - Scale the application with Kubernetes.

3. **Analytics**:
   - Implement usage analytics for channels and uploads.

4. **Advanced Versioning**:
   - Add features like diff comparisons for text-based files.

By following these steps, you can build a version control system similar to GitHub but tailored to your needs. Let me know if you'd like to expand on any section or need help implementing specific features!

## Update
As far I created telegram bot which can read message and reply to it,
and then I created GitHub script which commits file
